My name is Micha≈Ç Kruszewski.
I am an electronics systems engineer who uses programming to solve problems, not to create new ones.
I am usually responsible for the system's digital subpart and integration.
Most of the projects I worked on were related to embedded systems or HPC (High-Performance Computing).
I enjoy working on projects utilizing FPGA designs the most, although pure MCU or CPU-based projects also bring me joy.
</p>
<p>
I work at the Warsaw University of Technology, but I also implement projects for external companies.
Whenever I have a choice, I prefer working with VHDL, C, Go, and Python.
However, if there is a need, I adjust to my contractors' requirements.
I am a passionate proponent of open source who prefers simplicity and easiness over smartness and fanciness.
I am also cautious about following hype and trends.
</p>

<p>
I have decided to start the blog for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>
As a human being, I have my opinions and thoughts.
However, when you write an article that will to be reviewed in a scientific journal, you are not allowed to express opinions and thoughts, even if you have solid arguments for them.
In a blog post, you can share what you think in a casual way.
</li>
<li>
Sometimes, when I work on a project, I struggle to find information I am interested in.
I have to carry out experiments on my own.
I thought that sharing the knowledge I gain might be helpful for others looking for the same information.
</li>
<li>
I was already using a repository to back up some of the knowledge.
I have asked myself why not take a step forward and turn custom knowledge notes into blog posts.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
As I am not a English native speaker, please forgive me for any language shortcomings and mistakes.
