<h1>FreeBSD: Running Vivado on FreeBSD</h1>

<p>
For a very long time (like 4 or 5 years), I have been considering ditching Linux-based OSes in favor of FreeBSD.
There are multiple reasons to do so.
Just to name a few:
<ul>
  <li>
    Linux-based OSes are not orthogonal.
    Multiple init systems, various ways to configure the same things differently.
    I have been a Linux desktop and server user for more than 10 years.
    However, when I configure and use Linux based distro with Buildroot, I feel like a newbie.
    The Linux knowledge is not portable, because everything is done in a "different way" depending on the platform you target.
    Some say that this is because embedded applications are different than, for example, server applications.
    This is just thier opinion.
    My opinion is that there is no reason for such a state to be, and Linux environment is just a mess.
  </li>
  <li>
    Omnipresent bloat.
    Linux is becoming more like Windows and less like *nix.
  </li>
  <li>
    Linux is not governed by the community anymore.
    It is governed by Big Tech, and Big Tech cares only about money.
  </li>
</ul>However, this post is not about why I think FreeBSD is much better than Linux, so I am not going to discuss it here.
</p>

<p>
The only thing stopping me so far from switching entirely to FreeBSD was the fact that I work with FPGAs.
None of the FPGA vendors officially supports FreeBSD.
Without being able to run at least Vivado, I am not able to pay my bills.
Unless I change my profession, which I sometimes think of because there are multiple IT things easier to do than FPGA development, where you get much more money.
</p>

<p>
In this post, I am just going to list theoretical ways of running Vivado on FreeBSD.
Each of these ways (except the first one) is going to be described in a separate post.
</p>

<p>
I can think of the following 4 possible ways of running Vivado on FreeBSD.
<ol>
  <li>
    <b>Linuxulator without chroot.</b>
    I tried this method a couple of years ago.
    I was not able to run the GUI because of some Java errors.
    I failed in overcoming those errors, and I finally gave up.
    However, even if it was possible to run GUI, I would not recommend this way.
    Without chroot, you might encounter some subtle library and user space program differences that might crash Vivado in unexpected cases.
    Moreover, without chroot, you get no filesystem separation.
    Vivado can easily scan all files on your machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Linuxulator with chroot.</b>
    I have tried this method recently, and it works!
    I am going to describe it soon.
    With chroot, you get filesystem separation, but no network or process separation.
    Moreover, although you can synthesize designs generate bitstreams, etc., you can't program your devices as AMD drivers are not available for FreeBSD.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Linux jail.</b>
    Running Vivado in a Linux jail is almost the same as running Vivado with Linuxulator with chroot.
    I haven't tried it yet.
    However, as running Vivado with Linuxulator and chroot works, I expect running Vivado in a Linux jail also works.
    Compared to chroot, a jail provides you with network and process separation.
    The cost is a greater burden required to configure a jail.
    This method also doesn't allow programming devices directly from the Vivado GUI.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Linux in bhyve.</b>
    I haven't tried this yet, but I am sure it works.
    With bhyve, you basically run Linux.
    You don't simply "pretend" you run Linux.
    If you have a spare USB controller, you can even pass it to the virtual machine.
    You should be able to program devices directly from the Vivado GUI.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Using methods 2 (Linuxulator with chroot) and 3 (Linux jail) you can compile designs.
However, you are not able to program devices.
The good news is that there are decent solutions for this problem.
I haven't tried them yet, but I am sure some of them work (1 and 2), and I will describe them in separate posts.
<ol>
<li>Running Vivado hw_server on Raspberry Pi and connecting to it via network.</li>
<li>Running Vivado hw_server, or whole Vivado in virtual machine (bhyve).</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/kholia/xvc-pico">xvc-pico</a>. I think no one has tried to run it on FreeBSD so far, so it might require additional tweaks.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader">openFPGALoader</a>. It can be used for programming. However, I think debugging is not possible. I have never tried. </li>
</ol>
